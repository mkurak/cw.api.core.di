### Plan

1. Scaffold the package: init npm, TypeScript, Jest, ESLint/Prettier.
2. Design DI container API ensuring singleton behaviour across consumers.
3. Implement decorators, lifecycle handling (singleton/scoped/transient), session management, registration lists, discovery.
4. Build tests covering registration, resolution, scoped sessions, discovery, and integration scenario (entities/controllers).
